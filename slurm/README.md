# Slurm scripts to run `genome_entropy`

We have two versions of the scripts:

- [nvidia for installing and running on HPCs that use NVIDIA GPUs](nvidia)
- [rocm for installing and running on HPCs that use AMD GPUs](rocm)

Note, that infact most of the scripts are the same, they really only vary in the installation modules. However, we routinely switch between two different HPC systems that use NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, so we have separated them for convenience.
